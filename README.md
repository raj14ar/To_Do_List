# To_Do_List
About
This project was developed to maintain the to-do list. The front-end of this app was developed using Enhanced JavaScript (EJS), CSS, and JavaScript while the back-end part was developed using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This project taught me how to develop a project in a structured way and how to scale it on a large scale.
